Even as new drugs continue to be developed, the potential of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) threatens the prevention and treatment of various
microbe-caused diseases. According to the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention, there are more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant
infections each year resulting in over 35,000 deaths. Because of this, the
ability to identify and analyze the biological mechanisms behind AMR is
a pressing issue in the healthcare field.
Recent advances have made data annotating bacterial genetic regions
associated with AMR available through sources such as PATRIC.
Furthermore, machine learning methods have previously made use of this
data to then predict bacterial resistance based on genotype. In particular,
Mah√© and Tournoud made use of k-mers and stability selection to
predict bacterial resistance against various drugs based on whole bacterial
genomes.
This project proposes that deep learning models can be used to improve
on the results of previous machine learning methods. In particular, the
lack of data suggests that this task might benefit from one-shot or few-shot
learning. Unlike traditional deep learning classification models, one-shot
learning does not emphasize how the sample should be classified. Instead,
the model learns a feature embedding which separates the samples of
different classes from each other. Given the common difficulty of collecting
large corpora of data, various model types have been applied to one and
few-shot learning tasks. For this reason, our siamese network-based method is beneficial to
the task of predicting antibiotic resistance.
