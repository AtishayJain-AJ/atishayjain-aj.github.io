I am a 5th year PhD student in the computer science department at Brown University. I am advised by [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/). My research interests include machine learning, foundation models, graph neural networks and spatial transcriptomics.

Prior to joining Brown University, I completed my undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, earning the President's Gold Medal and Institute Gold Medal.
